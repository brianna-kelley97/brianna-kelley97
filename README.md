Hello, I'm Brianna Kelley!

I graduated from Texas State University in 2020 and I am currently working in Fort Worth, TX.

I will be using this account to explore projects outside of what I currently do at work as a 
Software Engineer. As well as a central location for group projects I completed as
a student that I no longer have access to, but can still be seen as a contributer.

I can be reached at bk311997@gmail.com
